### 1. Harnessing the Power of Compose Runtime

One of the standout features of XFrames is its use of **Compose Runtime**. Unlike full Compose Multiplatform, which often comes with additional complexity and dependencies, XFrames focuses on a **core, lean implementation** of declarative UI principles. This ensures you get the **performance benefits** of Compose without the **overhead**, keeping your development process fast and your applications lightweight.

### 2. XFrames: Native OpenGL Rendering for Smooth UIs

One of the standout features of XFrames is its ability to ensure your **UI runs at 60fps**, thanks to its native **OpenGL rendering** capabilities. While the focus is on the **Kotlin side**, XFrames efficiently manages the low-level rendering details, offering a smooth and responsive experience. Whether you're building performance-critical applications or high-end visual interfaces, XFrames ensures your UI remains fluid and responsive across all use cases, making it an ideal choice for developers prioritizing **smooth performance** and **native rendering**.

### 3. Yoga Layouts: Flexible, Responsive UIs

XFrames leverages **Yoga**, a powerful **flexbox-based layout system** designed for building **flexible, responsive UIs**. Yoga allows you to manage layouts effectively, without needing to deal with complex or bloated UI systems.

### 4. A Lightweight Framework for Maximum Performance

XFrames provides a **minimalist**, streamlined framework that removes unnecessary abstractions and focuses on delivering the best performance without the extra weight.

XFrames' **lightweight** approach means faster load times, significanly reduced memory usage, and quicker iteration cycles—ideal for developers who need **performance** but don’t want to compromise on flexibility or power.

### Conclusion: Lightweight, Powerful, and Flexible

For developers who want the benefits of **native performance**, **flexible layouts**, and **easy integration with native systems**, XFrames offers a compelling alternative to Compose Multiplatform. By leveraging the **Compose Runtime** and **XFrames JNI**, developers can build **lean, efficient applications** without sacrificing power or flexibility. Whether you're building a desktop application or an app that requires native performance, XFrames provides the right balance of **simplicity** and **power**—making it the perfect tool for your next project.

Start building your next native application today with XFrames and discover the difference that a **lightweight** yet **powerful** framework can make.
