At XFrames, we’ve always prioritized lightweight, high-performance UI development. Now, we’re bringing that power to [F#](https://github.com/xframes-project/xframes-fsharp), enabling functional programmers to craft expressive and reactive UIs with unprecedented efficiency.

### A functional first approach  

The F# implementation of XFrames takes full advantage of functional paradigms. By leveraging **Reactive Extensions (Rx)** for state management we deliver:  

- **Reactive UIs**: Seamless, declarative updates powered by reactive programming.  
- **Efficient Rendering**: Minimal overhead with diff-based updates for optimal performance.  

### Expressive DSL for clean UIs  

F# developers will feel right at home thanks to a **custom F# DSL** tailored for XFrames. Define UIs declaratively with composable, readable code that leverages F#’s elegant syntax.  

The result? Intuitive, maintainable code that focuses on **what** your UI should do, not how it should update.  

### Performance without Compromise  

XFrames continues its commitment to speed and efficiency. Just like our Kotlin implementation, the F# version focuses on:  

- **Lightweight Execution**: Minimal memory usage and quick load times.  
- **Smooth Performance**: Native-like responsiveness with no unnecessary abstractions.  

### A Work in Progress  

While F# support is still evolving, the groundwork is strong. We aim to provide a solid foundation for developers who value **functional programming** and **performance** in equal measure.  

We’re excited to refine this implementation further and look forward to feedback from the F# community as we shape the future of UI development in XFrames.
