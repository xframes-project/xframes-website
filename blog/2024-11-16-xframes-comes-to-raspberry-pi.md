[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) has transformed how we approach computing, offering a powerful and affordable platform for countless projects.

### Why XFrames is a Perfect Fit for Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi devices excel in lightweight, efficient computing environments, but traditional GUI frameworks often introduce unnecessary overhead. XFrames takes a different approach: a DOM-free architecture powered by a language of your choice, optimized for GPU rendering and lean execution. This ensures your applications are as responsive and resource-efficient as possible.

**What You Can Do with XFrames on Raspberry Pi**

- **Multiple programming languages support through FFI, JNI, and native modules**: Discover how you can interoperate with XFrames using your favourite programming language.
- **GPU-Accelerated Rendering**: Leverage the Pi's GPU for smooth and responsive GUIs.
- **React and Yoga Layouts**: Build modern, flexible interfaces with familiar tools.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Code on your desktop, deploy on your Raspberry Pi seamlessly.

### The Next Steps

This release is just the beginning for Raspberry Pi support in XFrames. We're committed to refining the experience, enhancing performance, and introducing new features tailored to Pi developers.
