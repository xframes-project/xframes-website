Building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) has always been a balancing actâ€”developers want performance, flexibility, and simplicity, yet most tools force compromises. That's why I created XFrames, a library designed to address these challenges and empower developers to build high-performance, cross-platform applications without relying on traditional web engines.

## Why XFrames?

The idea for XFrames was born out of frustration with existing solutions like Electron. While Electron revolutionized desktop app development, its reliance on Chromium makes applications heavier than necessary. This approach often consumes excessive resources, especially on lower-end devices like Raspberry Pi.

With XFrames, I wanted to create something different:

- A library that doesn't rely on a browser engine.
- A solution optimized for GPU rendering, capable of harnessing modern hardware effectively.
- A developer-friendly environment powered by **Dear ImGui** and **Yoga layouts**, enabling flexibility and a seamless transition for web and desktop software developers.

## What Makes XFrames Unique?

- **DOM-Free Architecture**: Unlike traditional frameworks, XFrames eliminates the browser DOM, reducing resource usage and improving performance.
- **Cross-Platform by Design**: Whether you're targeting desktop, Raspberry Pi, or future platforms, XFrames ensures consistency.
- **GPU-Accelerated Rendering**: Bring your interfaces to life with smoother animations and faster refresh rates.
- **WebAssembly (WASM) Compatibility**: XFrames also supports running in browsers through **WASM**, broadening its reach and versatility.

## The Road Ahead

XFrames is still in its early days, but the potential is immense. Here's what's next:

- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improving support for screen readers and assistive technologies.
- **Expanded Platform Support**: Beyond Raspberry Pi, the goal is to target additional devices and environments.
- **Developer Tools and Demos**: Offering examples, templates, and tools to simplify onboarding.
- **Community Collaboration**: Fostering a vibrant community to help shape XFrames' evolution.

## Who Should Use XFrames?

- desktop application developers;
- web developers who need to overcome the performance limitations of the DOM.

## Join the Journey

This is just the beginning of what I hope will be a transformative journey in GUI development. If you're interested in contributing, exploring, or just staying updated, check out the documentation and follow the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/andreamancuso/xframes).

Let's build something amazing together.
