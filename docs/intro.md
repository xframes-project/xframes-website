# What is XFrames?

XFrames is a high-performance framework for building native desktop applications with minimal overhead. Designed for developers who want to leverage the power of languages like JavaScript, Python, Lua, OCaml, and more, XFrames allows you to create applications without the usual resource-intensive web technologies like DOM, CSS, or Electron. By utilizing OpenGL and GLFW3 on native platforms or WebAssembly and WebGPU in the browser, XFrames provides fine-grained control over performance and memory usage.

## Getting Started

The requirements will depend on which programming language you wish to use with XFrames.

So far, XFrames has been tested with the following languages/platforms:

- Python
- C++
- Java
- C
- C#
- [JavaScript/TypeScript](/docs/category/typescript)
- Fortran
- Free Pascal
- Delphi
- Rust
- Ruby
- Swift
- Kotlin
- Ada
- Lua
- Scala
- Julia
- Haskell
- Gnu Step
- D
- F#
- Nim
- OCaml
- Gnu Smalltalk
- Zig
- Crystal
- Racket
- Factor
- WebAssembly

### JavaScript / TypeScript (Node.js)

#### Generate a new Node.js desktop application

```bash
npx create-xframes-node-app
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run your XFrames app.

Enter a project name, cd into the newly created project folder then run

```bash
npm start
```
